What is FINOd?
--------------

FINOd (pronounced fino di) is a PHP5 IRC bot built from scratch.


Why another IRC bot?
--------------------

In most cases I build my software on my own if I'm able to.
It just feels better for me.
And since I have an own IRC channel on irc.euirc.net I wanted to have a bot and here it is.

Where does the name come from?
------------------------------

Well... It actually was a typo. I wanted to write [INFO] and hit the keys in such a strange
order that I had [FINO] instead of [INFO]. And the d just stands for daemon like in sshd.
That's how the name was born.

How do I use FINOd?
-------------------

Well, it's very simple to use it.
Download it (git clone is my suggestion so you can stay uo to date easily) to any folder on your
server or home computer and run "php5 finod.php".
Important: You'll need to have php5 installed.

How does it work?
-----------------
Like every other IRC bot.
It asks for your credentials, connects to IRC with them, Ping-Pongs a little bit with the
server and joins your channel. There it listens for commands and will execute them.


That's it for now.
